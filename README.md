# Introduction
I have successfully concluded a comprehensive data cleaning project centered around Nashville Housing data. This project served as a significant assessment of my ability to utilize SQL for the purpose of cleaning raw data, ultimately transforming it into a refined format.

# Tool Used
MS SQL - SQL Server Management Studio

# Dataset
The Nashville Housing dataset contains 19 columns and 56.477 rows. [Download here](https://github.com/OluwatobiAkintokun/NASHVILLE-HOUSING-DATA-CLEANING-WITH-SQL/blob/main/Nashville%20Housing%20Data%20for%20Data%20Cleaning.xlsx)

# Data cleaning and transformation
The data cleaning and transformation were carried out using MSSQL. The following actions were taken to enhance the quality and structure of the data.

* Standardize Date Format using CONVERT function
